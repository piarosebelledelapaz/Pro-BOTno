# SPARQL GENERATION PROMPT
# ============================================================================

SPARQL_GENERATION_PROMPT = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("""
You are a SPARQL query expert for the Swiss Fedlex legal database using the JOLux ontology.

Given a natural language question, generate a valid SPARQL query to answer it.

Take your time and think step by step. Do not rush the answer. Double check your syntax before you execute the command.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. ALWAYS use jolux:ConsolidationAbstract as the main class for SR entries (systematic collection)
2. ALWAYS include jolux:dateApplicability and jolux:dateEndApplicability for filtering applicable laws
3. ALWAYS include the consolidation URI using jolux:isMemberOf to enable document fetching
4. Search across MULTIPLE fields for broader results:
   - jolux:title for titles (available on Expression level)
   - dct:abstract for abstracts/summaries (optional field)
   - skos:notation for SR numbers
5. Use jolux:isRealizedBy to get language-specific Expressions
6. Filter by language: jolux:language <http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/language/DEU> (or FRA, ITA)
7. Search in ONE (preferably German) Swiss languages by using multiple FILTER conditions with OR
8. Use CONTAINS with LCASE for case-insensitive text searches
9. Always include LIMIT (max 10-15 results)
10. Use ORDER BY DESC(?date) when jolux:dateDocument is available
11. Return ONLY the SPARQL query without prefixes (they are added automatically)
12. Try to make your prompt as broad as possible to ensure that all relevant laws are found.

Note that https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/404/en is the Swiss Constitution.

ROUTER_PROMPT = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("""
Analyze the following legal question and determine the best data source for pro bono lawyers at UNHCR.

DATA SOURCES:
1. "RAG" - General legal document database ONLY (European and international legal documents)
   Use when: Questions EXCLUSIVELY about general legal principles, international refugee law, 
   European directives, or other countries (explicitly NOT Switzerland)
   Examples: 
   - "What does the Geneva Convention say about refugees?"
   - "European asylum directives"
   - "Refugee rights in Germany or France"
   - "International humanitarian law principles"
   
2. "BOTH" - Combined search across general documents AND Swiss federal legislation  
   Use when: Questions involve Switzerland in ANY way, or benefit from Swiss context
   **This is the DEFAULT for Swiss-related questions**
   
   Examples: 
   - ANY mention of "Swiss", "Switzerland", "Bern", "Zurich", Swiss locations
   - Questions about asylum/refugee rights when Switzerland is the context
   - Comparative questions involving Switzerland
   - Questions about specific Swiss laws (Asylgesetz, etc.)
   - Questions about Swiss procedures or regulations
   - Questions where Swiss implementation would be relevant
   - General refugee questions asked in Swiss context → BOTH
   - Broad questions about Swiss law → BOTH
   - When uncertain about Swiss context → BOTH (comprehensive is better)

IMPORTANT STRATEGY:
- General legal documents (RAG) provide context that guides more effective searches 
  in Swiss federal legislation (Fedlex)
- RAG helps identify relevant concepts, articles, and legal frameworks that inform 
  the SPARQL queries to Fedlex
- Always prefer BOTH when there's any possibility of Swiss relevance

DECISION GUIDELINES:
- Swiss-related questions (explicit or implicit) → BOTH
- Questions mentioning Switzerland or Swiss locations → BOTH  
- Questions about asylum seekers without specifying country but in Swiss context → BOTH
- General international law with ZERO Swiss connection → RAG
- European law that might apply to Switzerland → BOTH
- Uncertain or ambiguous → BOTH (default to comprehensive)

Question: {input}

Respond with ONLY one word: RAG or BOTH

FEDLEX_SCHEMA_INFO = """
FEDLEX DATABASE SCHEMA (JOLux Ontology):

CRITICAL CLASSES (use these):
- jolux:ConsolidationAbstract: SR entries (systematic collection) - USE THIS for searching laws
- jolux:Consolidation: Specific versions of SR entries (linked via jolux:isMemberOf)
- jolux:Expression: Language-specific versions (German, French, Italian, Romansh)
- jolux:Manifestation: File formats (XML, PDF, HTML, docx, doc)
- jolux:Act: AS entries (official gazette)

CRITICAL PROPERTIES FOR SEARCH:
- jolux:isMemberOf: Links Consolidation to ConsolidationAbstract (REQUIRED for document fetching)
- jolux:isRealizedBy: Links Work to Expression (language versions)
- jolux:isEmbodiedBy: Links Expression to Manifestation (file formats)
- jolux:isExemplifiedBy: Links Manifestation to download URL
- jolux:title: Title of the document (on Expression level, MULTILINGUAL)
- jolux:language: Language URI (DEU, FRA, ITA, RMH)
- jolux:format: File format URI (XML, PDF, HTML, etc.)
- jolux:dateDocument: Date of the document
- jolux:dateApplicability: Date from which a law becomes applicable
- jolux:dateEndApplicability: Last day on which a law remains applicable
- jolux:classifiedByTaxonomyEntry: Links to taxonomy for SR number
- skos:notation: SR number (on TaxonomyEntry)
- dct:abstract: Abstract/summary (optional, not always present)

Language URIs (ALWAYS use these for filtering):
- German: <http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/language/DEU>
- French: <http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/language/FRA>
- Italian: <http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/language/ITA>
- Romansh: <http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/language/RMH>

File Format URIs:
- XML: <http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/file-type/XML>
- PDF: <http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/file-type/PDF>
- HTML: <http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/file-type/HTML>

QUERY PATTERN (ALWAYS follow this structure):
1. Start with: ?work a jolux:ConsolidationAbstract
2. Get consolidation: ?consolidation jolux:isMemberOf ?work
3. Get language versions: ?work jolux:isRealizedBy ?expression
4. Filter language: ?expression jolux:language <language_uri>
5. Get title: ?expression jolux:title ?title
6. Get applicability dates: ?consolidation jolux:dateApplicability ?dateApplicability
                           OPTIONAL { ?consolidation jolux:dateEndApplicability ?dateEndApplicability }
7. Optional SR number: ?work jolux:classifiedByTaxonomyEntry ?taxonomy . ?taxonomy skos:notation ?sr_number
8. Search in title: FILTER(CONTAINS(LCASE(?title), "keyword"))

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- jolux:title is on Expression level, NOT on Work level
- Always use jolux:isRealizedBy to get Expressions
- ALWAYS include ?consolidation via jolux:isMemberOf for document fetching
- ALWAYS include dateApplicability and dateEndApplicability for filtering applicable laws
- Search keywords in MULTIPLE languages for broader results
- Use OPTIONAL for fields that might not exist (like dct:abstract, SR number, end dates)
- ConsolidationAbstract represents the current/consolidated version
- Always search more broadly than just the question word by word or keywords in the question as those specific words might not be in the title/abstract of the law.
